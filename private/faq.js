        question: "My old URL is broken. WHY???",
        answer: "The new backend will breaks all existing URLs. We will provide no redirects. There are two reasons for this: 1) We want to complete redo our backend to be faster and simpler, dropping support makes this possible. and 2) Our old server is swamped with so many requests that it can't render anything, by killing off the old URI, we will reduce the amount of requests drastically and allow the app to scale again."
